# Chapter 6, Exercise 2: Movie Tickets:

# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
#Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket
user_age = "How old are you?"
user_age += "\nEnter 'quit' when you are finished. "

# to end the loop i want user to type "quit"
while True:
    age = input(user_age)
    if age == 'quit':
        break
    age = int(age)
# If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; 
    if age < 3:
        print("  You get in free!")
 # if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10;
    elif age < 13:
        print("  Your ticket is $10.")
 # and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15.
    else:
        print("  Your ticket is $15.")
