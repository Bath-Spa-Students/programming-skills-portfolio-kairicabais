# Chapter 2, practise 5: fruit basket

# Write a python program that stores fruit names in a list named fruits.
# Unpack the list into three variables x, y and z and then print the values of each variable.

# Create a list of strings
fruits = ["dragon fruit", "mandarin", "persimmon"]

# Unpack the list into variables
x, y, z = fruits

# Print the values of each variable
print("Value of x:", x)
print("Value of y:", y)
print("Value of z:", z)
