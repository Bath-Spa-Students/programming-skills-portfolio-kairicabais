# Exercise 5: Favorite Fruit

#Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.


#• Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
favorite_fruits = ['watermelon', 'lansones', 'santol']

#• Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list.
if 'wintermelons' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like wintermelons!")
if 'apples' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like apples!")
if 'mangoes' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like mangoes!")
if 'lansones' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like lansones!")
if 'santol' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like santol!")

#If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement,such as You really like lansones!
