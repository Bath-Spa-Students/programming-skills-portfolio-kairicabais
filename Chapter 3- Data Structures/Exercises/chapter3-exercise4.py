# Exercise 4: Guest List 

#If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite?
##Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. 
guests = [' Mr. Marco Bucci', 'Ms. Amala Dlamini', 'Mr. Damini Ogulu']

#Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
name = guests[0].title()
print("Greetings," + name + ", I would be pleased to have you tonight for dinner.")

name = guests[1].title()
print("Warm Welcomes, " + name + ", It would be an honor to have you join me for dinner.")

name = guests[2].title()
print("Sweet Greetings, " + name + ", you are welcome to join me tonight, for dinner.")
