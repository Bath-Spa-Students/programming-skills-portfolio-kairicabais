# Exercise 7: Seeing the World


# Store a list of 5 locations. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order!!
locations = ['Switzerland', 'Italy', 'Philippines', 'Thailand', 'China']

# Print your list in its original order.
print("Original order:")
print(locations)

# Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list. 
##Since we are only using sort(), the original variables don't get replaced.
print("\nAlphabetical:")
print(sorted(locations))

# Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
print("\nOriginal order:")
print(locations)

# Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.
print("\nReverse alphabetical:")
print(sorted(locations, reverse=True))

# Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
print("\nOriginal order:")
print(locations)

# Use reverse() to change the order of your list. Print the list to show that its order has changed.
print("\nReversed:")
locations.reverse()
print(locations)

# Use reverse() to change the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order. 
print("\nOriginal order:")
locations.reverse()
print(locations)

# Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has been changed.
print("\nAlphabetical")
locations.sort()
print(locations)

# Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has changed.
print("\nReverse alphabetical")
locations.sort(reverse=True)
print(locations)
